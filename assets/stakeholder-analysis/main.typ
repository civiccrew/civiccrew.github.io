== Stakeholders

- *Citizens / Residents* — Primary users who report civic issues such as waterlogging, drainage blockages, potholes, or malfunctioning streetlights. Complaints can be lodged via the Smart City mobile application or through a dedicated helpline.
- *Smart City App / Complaint Management Platform* — The central digital interface for logging complaints. It supports photo uploads, geotagging, text descriptions, and maintains a unified complaint registry.
- *Ward Supervisors (Local Officials)* — Responsible for receiving complaints within their jurisdiction. They review, validate, and assign tasks to the appropriate departmental teams.
- *Smart Office (Lalbagh — Central Control)* — Functions as the command center for the Nagar Nigam. It oversees complaint tracking, enforcement of service-level agreements (SLAs), escalation, and reporting.
- *Municipal Departments (Drainage, Electrical, Public Works, etc.)* — Specialized technical teams that execute the on-ground resolution of issues, based on the complaint category.

== Working Process

===  1. Complaint Registration
Citizens submit complaints through:
- *Mobile App* — Users upload photos and descriptions; complaints are automatically tagged with time, location, and other metadata.
- *Helpline / Call Center* — Operators log complaints on behalf of citizens, ensuring inclusivity for non-digital users.

=== 2. Complaint Forwarding
- The system automatically routes complaints to the *ward supervisor* of the relevant geographic area.
- Simultaneously, the platform categorizes the complaint (e.g., *Drainage*, *Streetlight*, *Roads & Potholes*).

=== 3. Department Allocation
- The complaint is mapped to the responsible municipal department:
  - Drainage Department → Sewerage and waterlogging issues
  - Electrical Department → Streetlight and power-related faults
  - Public Works Department → Roads, potholes, and infrastructure repairs

=== 4. Monitoring & Enforcement
- The *Smart Office* continuously monitors complaint resolution through dashboards and SLA tracking.
- An *escalation and penalty framework* ensures accountability: if a complaint is not addressed within the SLA, it may be auto-escalated or trigger financial penalties for the responsible department.

=== 5. Resolution Path (Example: Waterlogging)
1. Citizen reports waterlogging via the mobile app (category: *Drainage*).
2. Complaint is forwarded to the ward supervisor and then routed to the Drainage Department.
3. Field staff inspect and take corrective action (e.g., clearing blockages, opening sewer caps).
4. The team updates the status to *Resolved*. The update is reflected both in the citizen app and in the Smart Office’s central dashboard.

== Notes for Project Implementation

- *Data Model:* Complaints should capture complaint ID, timestamp, GPS coordinates, photos, category, citizen contact details, ward ID, supervisor ID, status history, and time-to-resolution.
- *Integrations:*
  - SMS/IVR for citizens without smartphones
  - Push notifications in the mobile app
  - Supervisor and department dashboards for workflow management
- *Enforcement & Governance:* SLA timers, escalation chains, and penalty rules must be clearly defined. Automatic alerts and fines promote responsiveness and accountability.)
